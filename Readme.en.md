üöÄ Study Repository: Machine Learning ZoomCamp

Introduction

This repository documents my learning journey and practical project development during the Machine Learning ZoomCamp, an intensive training program strongly focused on Machine Learning (ML) and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices.

The primary goal of this bootcamp is to go beyond simple model training, emphasizing the implementation, deployment, and scalability of ML systems in production environments. The content covers everything from statistical fundamentals and classic algorithms to Deep Learning and advanced orchestration using technologies like Kubernetes.

üìö Modules Overview

The bootcamp is structured into nine modules covering the entire ML project lifecycle:

- Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

    Focus: Establishing the theoretical and methodological foundation.

    Topics: Difference between ML and rule-based systems, Supervised Learning fundamentals, and applying the CRISP-DM methodology.

- Module 2: Machine Learning for Regression

    Focus: Building a car price prediction model.

    Topics: Implementing Linear Regression (with and without Scikit-learn), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and Regularization techniques.

- Module 3: Machine Learning for Classification

    Focus: Creating a customer churn prediction system.

    Topics: Logistic Regression, feature importance and selection, encoding categorical variables, and model interpretability.

- Module 4: Evaluation Metrics for Classification

    Focus: Properly evaluating the performance and robustness of classification models.

    Topics: Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score, constructing and analyzing ROC and AUC curves, Cross-validation, and handling class imbalance.

- Module 5: Deploying Machine Learning Models

    Focus: Turning the trained model into an accessible service (serving).

    Topics: Model serialization with Pickle, creating an API with FastAPI, and packaging the service using Docker for portability.

- Midterm Project

    Focus: Complete, practical ML application.

    Topics: A full-cycle project, from dataset search and model training to deployment of a functional web service.

- Module 6: Decision Trees & Ensemble Learning

    Focus: High-performance tree-based and ensemble models.

    Topics: Decision Trees, ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), alongside Hyperparameter Tuning techniques.
